The paper presents a front end program for setting up parametric studies on the ATP. Specific workings of the program for faulty cases, lightning cases and switching cases are presented.
Most commercially available programs have similar facilities and they are normally part of the user manual of the programs.
The paper makes reference to the license in section II. It is not customary to make references to licenses in a technical paper and I would suggest removal of the reference.
There are some minor typos, for example the word "inipientAngle" on page 3, the word "form" in abstract should be "from", etc. which can be easily corrected.

This is a well written paper discussing an open source toolbox for creating and performing numerous ATP simulations in an automated fashion. I have a couple of minor comments that would improve the paper:

1. Equation one is not legible for some reason. This should be corrected.

2. How is the processing time for this software? Some discussion would be of interest. Surely there are a net time savings as the automation is much faster than building cases manually, but some discussion would be good.
